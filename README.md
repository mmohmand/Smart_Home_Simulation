# Smart_Home_Simulation
This repository consists of simulation code and dataset for smart home energy management
This repository consists of simulation code and dataset for smart home energy management.
The repository consisted of three code files.
    1. Final LSTM with attention module for prediction purposes.
    2. Final optimization comparison of GA with attention module with PSO.
    3. final surplus energy calculations.
As we cannot upload more than 25MB of files to Git Hub, we request the data by emailing the following email address.

When using the dataset, I would suggest combining them in one file.
