# Smart_Home_Simulation
This repository consist of simulation code and dataset for smart home energy management
This repository consist of simulation code and dataset for smart home energy management.
The repository consisted of three code files.
    1. Final LSTM with attention module for prediction purposes.
    2. Final optimization comparison of GA with attention module with PSO.
    3. final surplus energy calculations.
As we cannot upload more than 25MB of file to github, we therefore, divide the dataset into multiple files.
In case to use the dataset, it is advised to combine them in one file.
